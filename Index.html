	<h2>How Do All-Electric Cars Work?</h2>
	<p>All-electric vehicles, also referred to as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), have an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine.<br>
	<p>The vehicle uses a large traction battery packThe vehicle uses a large traction battery pack &ndash; <span style="color:rgb(0, 64, 128)"><strong> to power the electric motor</strong></span> and must be<strong> plugged in to a wall outlet or charging</strong> equipment.</p><br>
	<p>Because it runs on electricity, the vehicle emits no exhaust from a tailpipe and does not contain the typical liquid fuel components.</p><br>
	<span style="color:orange"><strong>Controller [C]</strong></span> &ndash; takes and regulates electrical energy from <span style="color:orange"><strong>batteries [A] </strong></span> and <span style="color:orange"><strong>inverters [B]</strong></span>.<br>
	<span style="color:orange"><strong>Electric motor [D]</strong></span> &ndash; converts electrical energy into mechanical energy (rotation).<br>
	<span style="color:rgb(0, 20, 149)"><strong>Rotation of the motor</strong></span> &ndash; rotor rotates the transmission so the wheels turn and then the car moves.</p>

	<h4>Powering Vehicles with Electricity</h4>
	<p>Powering EVs with electricity is currently cost effective compared to using gasoline, but EVs typically cost more to purchase. However, initial vehicle costs can be offset by energy cost savings, a federal tax credit, and state incentives. Electricity for charging vehicles is especially cost effective if drivers can take advantage of off-peak residential rates and other incentives offered by many utilities. The cost is dependent on the price of electricity, which can vary by region, type of generation, time of use, and access point. </p><br>
