                        <p>We’d have it over an Audi RS6 or any Panamera. Only the rowdier E63 could possibly tempt us to the petrol side."</p>

                        <p>"Top Gear’s 2019 saloon of the year, beating the old guard and maintaining its lead of the new EV pretenders. It’s been in production since mid-2017, but even heading into middle age, nothing on the market has yet managed to beat the Model 3 on all fronts.</p>
                        <p>While not without flaws, it is quite simply one of the most interesting, compelling cars in the world right now."</p>

                        <p>“That Hyundai is now confident enough to put a car as bold-looking as the Ioniq 5 on sale is impressive. But the fact this retro XXL hot hatch bodywork conceals one of the most complete family EVs money can buy is downright remarkable.</p>
                        <p>If Hyundai can maintain this momentum behind the upcoming members of the Ioniq family, then the likes of VW’s ID cars and even Mercedes’s EQ clan ought to be extremely worried.”</p>

                        <p>“BMW will do battery versions of all its mainstream models – as it already has with the Mini Electric and iX3 – but it also wanted to build this all-in electric car as a showcase for its best work on materials, aerodynamics and driver assist.</p>
                        <p>The iX is a big comfy home-on-wheels, and a vast amount of technology has been poured into making sure the driver is soothed while the passengers kick back. It's efficient for a full-size e-SUV. The range is impressive, and it can recharge pretty rapidly too.”</p>

                        <p>"We loved the XC40 from the get-go but had a few reservations about the powertrains. Not any more. In battery-electric guise the XC40’s worthier attributes – the thoughtful packaging, sense of well-being and design – are augmented by a remarkable new turn of speed and handling smarts.</p>
                        <p>Like the Tesla Model 3 (and related Polestar 2), the XC40 P8 makes an almost irresistible case for electrification."</p>
